Research of an aspect of John Conway's Game of Life.
Four Gosper Glider Guns are created in the four corners of an area of Game of Life,
with their creation time optionally staggered. All of them shoot at the center of the
screen, and really to each other as well. Then we observe what happens. Will
any or all or some of the guns survive into a stable state? Guns are either killed
by mayhem engulfing them, OR by stray gliders. After some experimenting
it shows that it's possible to create stable states with all three possibilities.
